* Updated to 1.20.4
* Dropped Forge support, added (specific) NeoForge support
* Some changes to the tipped arrow & enchanted thingy trades
  * Now the output slot shows the possible items as if it is a `ListEmiIngredient` instead of showing simply "random effects" or annoyingly listing the possible enchantments in text
